# solr-5.3.1-web
I have combined the lucene&amp;solr source code with solr web UI to a normal Java Web project, so we can import it directly into the Eclipse then deploy and start solr as you can, more importantly, you can make a breakpoint in the source code, tracking source code execution, really understand the internal working principle.
